    <h1>Diplôme National Supérieur d’Expression Plastique, 2014<br />
    (National Superior Diploma in Graphic Expression)</h1>
    <h3> Diploma from École Européenne Supérieure d'Art de Bretagne, in Rennes, France</h3>
    <p>Narration and drawing were the major themes. This diploma explored the notion of action in a general way, through different approaches like narrative structures, for example : the monomyth, named and developed by Joseph Campbell in his famous book <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i> (1949).</p>
    <p>The goal was to dissect and analyze different narrative objects in American culture from the 30's and 40's (publishing, poster, film), to reinvest their codes in forms of narration promoting calm and contemplation.</p>
